**Overview**


AI Battle Arena (also known as Comics Chaos) is an engaging and interactive web application that enables users to simulate dynamic battles between fighters. Each fighter is equipped with unique abilities, stats, and health, offering a personalized and exciting experience for users. The app leverages the PeopleAi package, which integrates the langchain4j library to generate realistic fighter stats based on information accessible to OpenAI. Built using the Vaadin framework, AI Battle Arena provides a smooth user experience, featuring three distinct views. The logic is directly implemented within the views to simplify the interactions required for the simulation.

**Features**


    Fighter Selection: Users can choose from a variety of fighters, with their stats and abilities determined by OpenAI based on publicly available information.
    Real-time Battle Simulation: The app displays real-time combat scenarios between the selected fighters, showcasing interactions in a chat-like format. Users can review the entire battle history, tracking all actions taken by each fighter.
    Player Stats Generation: Fighter statistics are dynamically generated using the PeopleAi package, which pulls relevant data from the langchain4j library to ensure realistic and diverse attributes for each participant.
    Three-View Layout: The application features a streamlined, three-view layout that facilitates user interaction and simplifies the reuse of components throughout the app.
    Interactive User Interface: Built using the Vaadin framework, the user interface is highly interactive, featuring smooth transitions and immersive effects that enhance the user experience.
    User selection of attacks: Users are able to select from a selection of 3 attacks that the selected fighter is best known for. Open AI will then determine how much damage that attack will do to the other player resulting in a nice round based system.
