-Overview
AI Battle Arena is a dynamic web application that allows users to simulate battles between AI-powered fighters. Each fighter has unique abilities, stats, and health, providing an engaging experience. The app utilizes the PeopleAi package, which calls the langchain4j library to generate realistic player stats based on information available to OpenAi. It is built using the Vaddin framework and implements three distinct views, with main logic implemented directly within the views due to the simplicity of the required interactions.

-Features:
  Fighter Selection: Users can select fighters and OpenAi will determine their stats and abilities based on the information available on the internet.
  
  Real-time Battle Simulation: The application displays real-time battle scenarios between selected fighters. Interactions are displayed in the form of chat history, and user can retrieve all the actions     that happened before.

  Player Stats: Each fighterâ€™s stats are generated using the PeopleAi package, which fetches relevant data from the langchain4j library.

  Three-View Layout: The app is structured with three main views to facilitate interaction and easy components reuse.

  Interactive UI: Built using Vaddin, the user interface provides an immersive experience with seamless transitions and effects.
